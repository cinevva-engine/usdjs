## Support

This is an open source project with limited maintainer bandwidth.

### Best ways to get help

- **GitHub issues**: bug reports with a minimal repro (preferred)
- **Discussions** (if enabled): design questions and “how do I…” topics

### What to include

- `@cinevva/usdjs` version
- environment (Node version / browser / OS)
- a small USD file, or a public link + license info
- expected behavior (ideally compared to Pixar OpenUSD tools)
